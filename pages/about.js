            <h3>Sources</h3> 
            <p> &emsp; Books are gatherede from several different sources. PDF`&apos;` and some EPUB`&apos;`s are taken from Google, with some PDF`&apos;`s taken from other educational sites. 
            Webpages are from the great people at <a href="www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a>. EPUB and AZW3 formats are mainly taken from the minds behind <a>Standard Ebooks</a>. 
            Movies are taken from sites like YouTube, Wikipedia, or Archive.org. At the moment the focus is on hosting movies that are not just silent films. While they are in the public domain there is limited storage for these films.
